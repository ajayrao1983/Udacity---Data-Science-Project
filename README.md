# Udacity---Data-Science-Project

##Libraries Used:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn

##Motivation for the project
As part of the Data Science course curriculum at Udacity, I had to submit a project applying the concepts taught over the course. There were multiple datasets to choose from.
I found the Airbnb datasets and questions framed on Kaggle to be very interesting. Having used Airbnb myself, I was interested to know more about the type of data that is available and kind of business questions that management at Airbnb tries to answer.

I have framed and tried to answer the following 3 questions:
1. What are the busiest times of the year in Seattle and Boston?
2. Do prices show any seasonality? Do prices spike during peak season?
3. Which are the key drivers of occupancy rates? Are these different for Boston and Seattle?


##Datasets Used
I have used the following two datasets for Boston and Seattle:
1) Calendar: Daily availability and price for each listing id, covering 365 days.
2) Listings: Details about each listing, including average review score and full descriptions.


##What did I find
1. Busiest period for Boston is spring (Mar to Jul) and for Seattle is summer (Jul to Sep)
2. Prices peak in summer for both cities, and do show some seasonality though it would be better we had two years of data to analyze
3. Property type turned out to be top most driver of occupancy rate, followed by location accuracy and requirement of profile picture by the listing
